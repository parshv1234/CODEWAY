## Quiz Game

### Overview
The Quiz Game is a Python script that simulates a multiple-choice quiz. It consists of two classes: `MCQuestion` to represent individual quiz questions, and `QuizGame` to manage the quiz, track the player's score, and display results. The script allows players to answer questions, provides feedback on correctness, and displays the final score.

### Features
1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:** The script supports multiple-choice questions with shuffled answer choices.

2. **Dynamic Question Presentation:** Questions are presented in a randomized order, and answer choices are shuffled for each question.

3. **User Interaction:** The game engages players by prompting them to select answers using letter choices (e.g., A, B, C).

4. **Score Tracking:** The player's score is tracked throughout the game, and the final score is displayed at the end.

5. **Play Again Option:** After completing the quiz, players have the option to play again.

### Classes
1. **MCQuestion:**
   - Represents a single multiple-choice question.
   - Attributes:
      - `text`: The text of the question.
      - `choices`: List of answer choices.
      - `correct_choice`: The correct answer.

   - Methods:
      - `shuffle_choices`: Shuffles answer choices and updates the correct choice accordingly.
      - `is_correct`: Checks if the user's choice is correct.

2. **QuizGame:**
   - Manages the quiz gameplay.
   - Attributes:
      - `questions`: List of `MCQuestion` objects.
      - `score`: Player's score.
      - `question_no`: Current question number.

   - Methods:
      - `display_welcome_message`: Displays a welcome message at the beginning of the game.
      - `present_question`: Presents a question to the player, takes input, and provides feedback.
      - `play_game`: Initiates the quiz game loop.
      - `display_final_results`: Displays the final score and completion message.
      - `play_again`: Asks the player if they want to play again.

### How to Use
1. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script by running the `quiz_game.py` file.

2. **Answer Questions:**
   - Answer each multiple-choice question by entering the letter corresponding to your choice.

3. **Final Score:**
   - After completing the quiz, the script displays the final score and provides an option to play again.

4. **Play Again:**
   - Choose to play the quiz again or exit the game.

### Integrated Libraries and Algorithms
- **Random Module:** Utilized for shuffling answer choices and presenting questions in a randomized order.

### IDE and API
- **IDE:** The code was developed using a Python-friendly Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook.

- **APIs:** The script relies on standard Python libraries and does not require external APIs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- Expansion of question bank for more variety.
- Inclusion of a timer for each question.
- Implementation of difficulty levels.
