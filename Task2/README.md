TASK-2
Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Prompt the
user to input two numbers and an operation choice. Perform the
calculation and display the result.

This was pretty simple but i made it on a moderate level by adding some 
more arithmetic operators.

Also I have used lambda operator and if else loop in the program with "__name__"
variable.
It cannot perform simultaneous calculations as it is a simple one.
I have put a loop which asks user that if they want to run it or not.
